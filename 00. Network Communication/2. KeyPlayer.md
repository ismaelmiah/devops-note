## Host

> The term **host** is a generic term that implies **any sort of end-device on the internet**. Any device which might be the original initiation of traffic or the final destination of traffic can be considered a host.

- **The client is the entity initiating the request**
- **The server is the entity receiving the request**

## Network

*A Network is simply two or more connected device*.
> The whole **Internet** is nothing more than a series of **Inter**-connected **networks**.

## Switch

A **Switch** is a network device whose **primary purpose is to facilitate communication within networks**.
- Switch operate at Layer-2 of the OSI model.

- A switch operates by maintaining **MAC Address table**. This is a table that **maps MAC addresses of devices plugged into each switch port**.

## Router
The **Router**'s primary purpose is to facilitate communication between networks.
- **Routers operate at Layer-3 of the OSI Model.** The Layer-3 header contains information that enables *end to end delivery*.

- The Route Table is a map of every network that exists.
- When a router receives a packet destined to a network which is not in it's Routing Table, that packet is discarded.

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

**A**ddress **R**esolution **P**rotocol (**ARP**) is the bridges of Layer-2 MAC addressing scheme and Layer-3 IP addressing scheme.

**ARP will use the known IP address, and discover the unknown MAC address.** The discovered mapping is then added and stored in an **ARP Table, which is a mapping of IP addresses to correlating MAC addresses.**

**When a Client is attempting to speak to to a host in the same network, the Client will issue an ARP request for the host's MAC address.**

ARP will allow the client to complete the layer-2 header as above.

**When a Client is attempting to speak to a host in a foreign network, the Client will issue an ARP request for the Default Gateway's MAC address**.

# Host to Host Communication
The communication is happening within the same network - therefore, **Host A** and **Host B** are both configured with IP addresses that belong to the same network.

Each host has a unique IP address and MAC address. Sinch each host is also a Layer-3 device they also have an **ARP** table. Initially their ARP tables are empty.

**Host A** generate some data for **Host B** and **Host A** know the final destination IP address and also it's own IP address but it required the MAC address of **Host B** to create Layer-2 header to deliver the packet to **Host B**'s NIC.
- So, **Host A** made a ARP Broadcast request to know the destination MAC address (If there is someone out there with the IP xx.xx.xx.xx, please send me your MAC address.)

- **Host B** received that ARP request with some data of **Host A** (MAC and IP). Now **Host B** will add a record to it's own ARP table.

- The **ARP Response is sent as a Unicast** message, directly addressed to **Host A**.
- **Host A** now update it's ARP table. Now **Host A** can successfully put together there proper Layer-2 header to get the packet to the **Host B**.

> The key thing to note is a host doesnâ€™t know whether it is connected to a switch or directly to another host. In either case, the host will follow the process outlined above when trying to communicate with another host.

# Host to Host through a Router

Router's primary purpose is to facilitate communication between networks. Every router creates a boundary between two networks, and their main role is to forward packets from one network to the next.

> The routing table is the map of all networks in existence.

*The Routing Table starts empty, and is populated as the Router learns of new routes to each network.*

The **Router will known the network to which it is directly attached**.


## Static Route

A static route is a route which is **manually configured by an administrator**. When R1 learned of the two Directly Connected routes, and after R1 was configured with the one Static Route, R1 would have a routing table.

Route contains a **mapping of Networks to Interfaces or Next-Hop addresses**.

Every time router consult it's routing table whenever receives a packet.


## Dynamic Routing

The routers detecting and speaking to one another automatically to inform each other of their known routes.

## Host A getting the Packet to R1
Host A will create the L3 header with a Source IP address of 11.11.11.77, and a Destination IP address of 22.22.22.88 (for Host B) or 33.33.33.99 (for Host C). This L3 header will serve the purpose of getting the data from ‘end to end’.

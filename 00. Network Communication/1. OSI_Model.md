# OSI Model
**The Open Systems Interconnect model (OSI Model) explains all the individual functions that are necessary for the Internet to work.**

*It is a set of seven **independent** functions which combine to accomplish the end-goal of Computer to Computer communication*.

| Application Layer | 7 |
|--|--|
| Presentation Layer | 6 |
| Session Layer | 5 |
| Transport Layer | 4 |
| Network Layer | 3 |
| Data Link Layer | 2 |
| Physical Layer | 1 |

## OSI Layer - 1 - Physical
*The Physical layer of the OSI model is responsible for the transfer of bits -- the 1's and 0's which make up all computer code.*
> Layer 1 is anything that carries 1's and 0's between two nodes. ex: Ethernate cables.

## OSI Layer - 2 - Data Link
*The Data Link layer of the OSI model is responsible for interfacing with the Physical layer. Effectively, Layer 2 is responsible for putting 1's and 0's on the wire, and pulling 1's and 0's from the wire*
> Layer 2 will then group together those 1's and 0's into chunks known as Frames.

There is an addressing ssytem that exists at layer 2 known as the Media Access Control address(MAC). The MAC address uniquely identifies each individual NIC. Each NIC is pre-configured with a MAC by the manufacturer; it is sometimes known as Burned In Address (BIA).
> The overarching function of the **Data Link layer** is to deliver packets from one NIC to another. **The role of Layer 2 is to deliver packets from hop to hop**.

## OSI Layer - 3 - Network
*The Network layer of the OSI model is responsible for packet delivery from end to end*.

Routers are Network Devices that operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model. **A Router's primary responsibility is to facilitate communication between Networks**. As such, a Router creates a boundary between two networks. In order to communicate with any device not directly in your network, a router must be used.

## Layer 2 vs Layer 3
The interaction and distinction between these layers is crucial to understand how data flows between two computers.
- **Layer 2** uses **MAC addresses** and is responsible for packet delivery from **hop to hop**.
- **Layer 3** uses **IP addresses** and is responsible for packet delivery from **end to end**.

## OSI Layer 4 - Transport
*The Transport layer of the OSI model is responsible for distinguishing network streams*.

When a user accessing internet for browsing, listening music or streamd, while a messenger or chat application is running. Each applications are sending and receiving data from the internet, and all that data is arriving in the form of 1's and 0's on to that computer's NIC.
> Something has to exist in order to distinguish which 1's and 0's belong to the messenger or the browser or the streaming music. That "something" is Layer 4

> Layer 4 accomplishes this by using an addressing scheme known as Port Numbers.

Specifically, two methods of distinguishing network streams exist. They are known as TCP and UDP. Bother have 65,536 port numbers (each), and a unique application stream is identitified by a source and destination port(combination with source and destination ip address).

> Layer 4 is responsible for service to service delivery.

## OSI Layer 5, 6, and 7
*The Session, Presentation, and Application layers of the OSI model handle the final steps before the data transferred through the network is displayed to the end user.*

The distinction between Layers 5, 6, and 7 is not perticularly significant. In fact, there is another popular internet communication model known as the **TCP/IP** model, which groups these three layers into one single encompassing layer.

## Encapsulation and Decapsulation
*These terms refer to **how data is moved through the layers from top to bottom when sending and from bottom to top when receiving**.*

As the data is handed from layer to layer, each layer adds the information it requires to accomplish its goal before the complete datagram is converted to 1's and 0's and sent across the wire.

- Layer 4 will add a TCP header (include Source and Destination port)
- Layer 3 will add an IP header (include source and destination IP)
- Layer 2 will add an Ethernet header (include a source and Destination MAC)
